    "We observe phenomenon in the environments around us and take measurements to create data sets to help us derive understanding about our world that can benefit us moving forward. Statistics seeks to quantify the reliability of conclusions we might draw from the data, while Data Science seeks to leverage generalizable conclusions to improve business effectiveness and create competitive advantages. Statistics is thus the science of learning from data, while Data Science is a relatively new interdisciplinary field that includes the computational aspects of acquiring, managing, and analysing data.  What really makes these desciplines useful, however, is our ability to communicate our findings in a clear and convincing manner that cataylzes appropriate actions and respnoses from decision makers and key stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This course will focus on the reasoning, computation, and communication skills which are central to the related disciplines of Statistics and Data Science. We'll use the `python` programming language and the UofT JupyterHub cloud computing environment (which students will need to access through personal computers or university computer workstations) and students will gain practical experience understanding and performing statistical and data science topics and communicating about these methodologies and analyses. \n",

    "# Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Enable students to write code to perform data analysis, including normalizing troubleshooting and learning as routine activities of this exercise \n",
    "    - Class lectures will be based on on-the-fly coding demonstrations; and, students will practice coding through homework exercises\n",
    "    - A group-based course project will additionally provide students with practical coding based data analysis experience throughout the semester \n",
    "2. Instill a deep understanding of key data analysis concepts: data wrangling, populations and samples, visualizations, parameters and statistics, sampling distributions, simulation and bootstrapping, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, linear regression and classification, etc.\n",
    "    - Class tutorials will use the more intimate and interactive format to further examine key concepts underlying the methods demonstrated in class\n",
    "    - Homeworks and exams will push the limit of understanding by considering generalizations of the topics and concepts presented in class\n",
    "3. Improve communication skill and ability through frequent writing exercises and a course project presentation involving a group presentation\n",
    "    - The course involves a lot of coding, but the coding homeworks often include expositions introducing students to new topics as part of the homework and include many writing based questions; and, tutorial activities and tutorial assignments are typically writing assignments\n",
    "4. Acclimate and Integrate into your new life as a university student and learn how to be successful here at UofT through structured study habits \n",
    "    - Make friends and a community where you belong through Tutorials, [Recognized Study Groups](https://sidneysmithcommons.artsci.utoronto.ca/recognized-study-groups/), [Meet to Complete](https://sidneysmithcommons.artsci.utoronto.ca/meet-to-complete/) ([previously enrollment link](https://q.utoronto.ca/enroll/8CXECE)), and other UofT Groups\n",
    "    - Engage in the UofT The STA130 Mentorship Program designed to faciliate finding opportunities to join in and build community here at UofT\n",

    "Students will generally be attending the 4 hours of weekly lectures and tutorials. Beyond that, it is expected that the average student will devote at least an additional 6 hours per week outside of these hours to general studying, weekly homework, and tutorial assignments. This might end up being something like 4 hours of working on the weekly homework while reviewing the lecture notebooks and recordings to help with the coding homework completion, and then an hour or so getting some help from an office hour or piazza, and then another hour to complete the tutorial assignment on Friday or over the weekend. It is also expected that some weeks will require additional hours of effort beyond this.  For example, students struggling with a particular concept or idea or generally needing more help with coding due to being newer to coding would likely need to devote additional time seeking out help through office hours.  Additionally, while Course Project related submissions occur in weeks where there are no other assigments, they may nonetheless be quite time demanding. Specifically, in the week of Oct 30 **Project Assignment #1** is due on Nov 3 the same day as the **Midterm Exam** which students will likely want to devote study time towards. And the weeks of Nov 20, Nov 27, and Dec 4 at the end of the semester will likely be extra busy as well since the Course Project is due on Dec 7, and it will very likely be the case that course project groups will end up spending additional time finalizing their projects in order to be ready for their Dec 7 presentations. \n",

    "<!-- > All exam questions will be written answer questions, and will many times involve code and writing code. Additionally, the final exam is necessarily comprehensive as the material in the course naturally builds on itself and depends on previously introduced topics in order to develop and extend into the more advanced concepts.  The way to do well in the course, then, is to solidly understand all the coding and concepts intoduced in the class.  This way, when new topics and ideas are presented on the exams which are variants of the topics we've covered in class, you will be familiar and comfortable with the concepts of the course and be able to generalize what you know in order to answer the exam questions. -->"

To get credit, attend one event from each of the first two pillars, and meet with an STA130 mentor. For each activity, you'll write and submit a paragraph with your reflections on what you learned from the activity. Please allow up to 2 weeks from the date of activity and your reflections submission for the grade to be recorded. You can register for the events on the Mentorship SharePoint page via this link [HERE](https://utoronto.sharepoint.com/sites/ArtSci-STA/Mentorship/SitePages/STA130-Mentorship-Program-Home.aspx).\n",

Come to your meeting prepared with questions; the mentors are friendly and ready to answer questions about it all (academic, social, homesickness, time planning, and more). \n",
