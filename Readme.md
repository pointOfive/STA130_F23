1. [10-15 hours] Syllabus/Data Wrangling: Review and note any issues you encounter
   - Watch videos (2x speed is available)
   - Review Notebook
   - Do Homework [This is the style of homework you'll be creating -- note time required and potential edits]
   - Review Tutorial [You'll be making tutorials in this same manner]
   - Review Resources [seeing how they were leveraged to create the homework, tutorial, etc.]

2. [10-12 hours] Create your first homework/tutorial set
   - Lucie 
      - The tutorial for *Visualization* should be focused around "describing distributions" using terms like skew, symmetric, unimodal, median, percentile, quartile/IQR, mean, standard deviation, etc. I am expecting to rely primarily on the tutorial time to communicate these conceptual/conversational terminologies. Some of this could be included as an introduction into the homework as well, as a kind of "tutorial" in the homework to get students started on this.
      - The primary tutorial activity should follow up on the *Data Wrangling* tutorial exercise and be of the same style, using either the oly12countries data set or coffee.csv data set, or another data set that you think best lends itself to plotting and describing data distributions.
   - Matthew
      - *Hypothesis Tests* will introduce (one sample) permutation p-values; and, bootstrap confidence intervals will have already been covered, so operationalizing this simluation based methodology should be fairly comfortable as a topic for the students. Therefore, we'll also introduce the nonparametric sign (median, wilcoxon signed rank) test and the parametric t-test alternatives through their `scipy.stats` (`wilcoxon` and `ttest_1samp`, respectively) function calls. Considering all three tests allows us to compare and contrast simulation, nonparametric, and parametric testing, with the latter two being theoretical (rather than simulation-based) but only the t-test requiring a parametric assumption (since the underlying binomial distribution of the sign test is not an assumption, but a fact).  The video shows my treatment of this. I think it is too advanced to show how the sign and t-test work and how they calculate p-values using the binomial distribution and the t-distribution; but/and, I think the tutorial should be oriented around a mini-lecture/presentation/demonstration of a worked example of a hypothesis test for a proportion.
      - The "Wheel of Destiny" is probably a prime example to use for tutorial.
      - The tutorial should also spend time clarifying the difference between the data distribution and the sampling distribution of a test statistic.
      - *Two Samples* will reintroduce confidence intervals and the above hypothesis in a two-sample contexts (of the nonparametric permutation test and the two sample median test and t-test, `scipy.stats` `median_test` and `ttest_ind` repspectively) . This is meant to provide a second pass over the hypothesis testing material at a slightly more advanced level.
   - Rohan
      - This will use `statsmodels`; but, I'd also like to see you introduce `scikit-learn` because it not only prepares students for classification but also provides an easy conversation about why `sklearn` (as a predictive machine learning library) doesn't provide any p-values or uncertainty estimation while `statsmodels` does.
   - Cole
      - Video recording currently takes 2 hours and 45 minutes to get to model complexity selection with `GridSearchCV`... too long... you'll have some options for what to do in the last class between review and ethics... Seems to me reproducibility->algorithmic bias would be a good ethics topic and out of sample performance could be moved into the last class to motivate those as ethical topics to explore... but you are definitely not going to be time rich for that last class... I'm okay with that though and I'm not particularly committed to using the last class for a review of any sort... happy to leave that to the students and their study groups... kinda just depends on what feels good to you and what you end up suggesting we do, I think (perhaps maybe).
