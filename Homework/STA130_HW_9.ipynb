    "Comapared to understanding the contribution of different covariates towards the final predicted values of multiple linear regression models (where you can just read off the equation to see how predictions work), the extent to which we do not understand the overall contributions of the different features to the final predictions from our decision trees should feel a bit off-putting. To remedy this we can use so-called **Feature Importance** heuristics to judge how relatively important the different features are in the final decision tree predictions. There are a number of ways to do this (such as counting the number of nodes which split on each feature divided by the total number of splits in the tree), but as seen in the [scikit-learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html), a fit `DecisionTreeClassifier` model has a `.feature_importances_` attribute which measures the relative  contribution of each feature to the explanatory power of the model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> The way a decision tree is fit is that at each step in the construction process of adding a new decision node splitting rule to the current tree is structure, all possible decision rules for all possible variables are considered, and the one that improves the prediction the most (as measured by the criterion of either \"Gini impurity\" or \"Shannon entropy\") and legally and sufficiently according to the tuning parameters rules of the decision tree is added to the decision tree.  The overall \"criterion\" noted above improves with each new decision node splitting rule, so the improvement can thus be tracked and the contributions attributed to the feature upon which the decision node splitting rule is based.  This means the relative contribution of each feature to the overall explanatory power of the model can be calculated, and this is what the `.feature_importances_` attribute does. "
