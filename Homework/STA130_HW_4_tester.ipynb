A \"sampling distribution\" can be derived theoretically in some cases; or, simulated by resampling from the population (if it's available) over and over (and recalculating the statistic in each sample and visualing the distribution of these \"sampled\" statistics). What we're doing in this problem is creating what can be referred to \"bootstrap sampling distribution of the sample statistic\", wherein we presume the sample we have is sufficiently representative of the population to allow us to proceed by using it as such: the sample \"replaces\" the population with us pretending that the sample is a suitable stand in for the population. \n",
