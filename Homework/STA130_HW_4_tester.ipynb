So, it is not surprising that both estimated distributions are similar in terms of shape, centre and spread. They are both approximately symmetric and unimodal, their means are relatively close (63.7 and 66.3 years respectively). \n\nThe estimate of the sampling distribution in Q11 was obtained by sampling directly from the population; whereas the estimate of the sampling distribution in Q13 was obtained by resampling (i.e., taking bootstrap samples) from a specific random sample of 20 claims. If the sample is not representative of the population of claims, then the estimate of the sampling distribution based on bootstrap samples from that non-representative sample will not reflect the sampling distribution of mean ages very well."
