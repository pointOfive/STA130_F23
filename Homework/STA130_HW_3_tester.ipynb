    "\n",
    "The notion of numeric data types versus non-numeric data types, like numbers versus words, should be fairly intuitive to you.  And therefore, the distinction between numeric and categorical variables should hopefully also be fairly clear as well.  Actually, for technical clarity and communication, it can sometimes be beneficial to break down variables into even finer categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Note that categorical/qualitative data types can be encoded as numerical values. E.g., **ordinal** values could reported as integer scores \"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.\", and so could **nominal** values as long as we remember that the numeric order doesn't matter.  **Binary** variables are a simple example since they could be recorded as either $0$ or $1$. An easy example of a **binary variables** is a **logical/boolean** value like how `python` has `True` and `False` values.  In the case of **logical/boolean** values it is standard to coerce `False` to $0$ and `True` to $1$ whenever actual numeric values are required in place of **logical/boolean** values."

The two-bin histogram definitely appears too coarse to really get a good sense for the shape of the data, but in this regard using about 50 bins may be preferred because this shows how quickly the decay of the `view_count` data actually is. From the histogram with about 50 bins we can see that something like half of the `view_count` are less than 20,000; so, we might expect that the median would be around 20,000 and then the mean would be greater than that due to the long right tail of large values.  The boxplot turns out to be a very nice visualization in this instance since we can see that the 50th percentile (median) of the data is about 35,000, and the shape of the boxplot which shows that the 25th and 75th percentiles are close to 0 and 100,000 respectively, which in conjunction with the median and the whiskers and outliers of the boxplot, strongly suggests the right-skewed and unimodal nature of the `view_count` data.\""
